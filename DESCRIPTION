Title: Alternative spectral clustering, with automatic estimation of k.

Includes a spectral clustering implementation, a locally adapted kernel function akin to what is already proposed in kernlab, and an optional procedure that automatically estimates the optimal number of clusters. Several sample data sets are also included.
